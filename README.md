# Dotfiles - quick account setup for GitHub Codespaces

This is not a complete machine set-up, as there's a lot more to it, but it
is a good set-up of a new Codespaces instance when I want to quickly get
something running there.

All it does is to install a pared-down set of dot files and directories to
the new Docker instance so that I don't have to worry about aliases, and
all that.
